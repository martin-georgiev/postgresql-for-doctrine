# Decision Making

## Drop Problematic Features Early
When a feature proves difficult to test properly, has version compatibility issues, or requires excessive workarounds, consider dropping it rather than accumulating technical debt. A smaller, solid feature set is better than a larger, fragile one.

## Ask Before Expanding Scope
When fixing an issue reveals related problems or opportunities for improvement, ask before expanding scope. Don't proactively "fix" things that weren't requested.
