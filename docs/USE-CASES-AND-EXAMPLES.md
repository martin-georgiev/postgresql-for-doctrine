Clarification on usage of `ILIKE`, `CONTAINS`, `IS_CONTAINED_BY`, `DATE_OVERLAPS` and some other operator-like functions
---

`Error: Expected =, <, <=, <>, >, >=, !=, got 'ILIKE'"` (or similar) is probably one of the most common DQL errors you may experience when working with this library. The cause for is that when parsing the DQL Doctrine won't recognize `ILIKE` as a known operator. In fact `ILIKE` is registered as a boolean function.
Doctrine doesn't provide easy support for implementing custom operators. This may change in the future but for now it is easier to trick the DQL parser with a boolean expression.

Example intent with PostgreSQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM emails WHERE subject ILIKE 'Test email';
```

Intuitively, one may assume the below DQL. However it will not work:
```sql
SELECT e
FROM EmailEntity e
WHERE e.subject ILIKE 'Test email'
```

The correct DQL is with a boolean expression that will parse correctly and can look like this:
```sql
SELECT e
FROM EmailEntity e
WHERE ILIKE(e.subject, 'Test email') = TRUE
```

Using JSON_BUILD_OBJECT and JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT
---

These functions currently only support string literals and object references as arguments. Here are some valid examples:

```sql
-- Basic usage with string literals and entity properties
SELECT JSON_BUILD_OBJECT('name', e.userName, 'email', e.userEmail) FROM User e

-- Multiple key-value pairs
SELECT JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT('id', e.id, 'status', 'active', 'type', e.userType) FROM Employee e

-- Invalid usage (will not work):
SELECT JSON_BUILD_OBJECT('count', COUNT(*))  -- Aggregate functions not supported
SELECT JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT('number', 123)     -- All number types, NULL and boolean values not supported currently
```

Note: Keys must always be string literals, while values can be either string literals or object property references.
